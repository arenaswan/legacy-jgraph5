legacy-jgraph5
==============

The JGraph 5 legacy codebase.

DO NOT use this project for starting a new project unless you have a really good reason to. Development on the project 
stopped in 2009, we don't support it and only make updates for critical issues (which there has only been 1 in the 
last 4 years). Do not raise issues on it, they will be deleted. If you wish to fork and maintain the project, you are 
welcome to.
